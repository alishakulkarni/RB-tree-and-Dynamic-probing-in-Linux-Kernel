The project contains the following files:

->	rbt530_drv.c (Driver for RB tree structure)

->	rbt530.h

->	main.c	(User code)

->	Makefile	

->      RBprobe.c



In order to implement this project, following things need to be done:


1. make clean

2. make all

3. insmod rbt530_drv.ko

4. insmod RBprobe.ko

5. gcc -Wall -pthread -o main main.c

6. ./main a b c

	 
	*******Very Important*****
While ./main, a and b need to be passed in the command line, where a = device number and b = IOCTL command(Ascending/Descending), c = probe_write/probe_read


	rbt530_dev1 - ./main 1  0  probe_write/probe_read    (Type either read or write not both)
                      ./main 1  1  probe_write/probe_read           

        rbt530_dev2 - ./main 2  0  probe_write/probe_read  
                      ./main 2  1  probe_write/probe_read   

7. dmesg

8. rmmod RBprobe.ko

7. rmmod rb530_drv.ko

8 rm main



The log files in the folder show a sample of the read/write of the rbtree.The kprobe can be inserted 
	in the read/write with either of the devices
