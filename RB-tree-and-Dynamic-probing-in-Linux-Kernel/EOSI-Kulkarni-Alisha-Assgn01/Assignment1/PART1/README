The project contains the following files:

->	rbt530_drv.c (Driver for RB tree structure)

->	rbt530.h

->	main.c	(User code)

->	Makefile	




In order to implement this project, following things need to be done:


1. make clean

2. make all

3. insmod rbt530_drv.ko

4. gcc -Wall -pthread -o main main.c

5. ./main a b

	 
	*******Very Important*****
While ./main, a and b need to be passed in the command line, where a = device number and b = IOCTL command(Ascending/Descending)


./main 1 0 - Read/Write into rbt530_dev1 in Ascending order
./main 1 1 - Read/Write into rbt530_dev1 in Descending order

./main 2 0 - Read/Write into rbt530_dev2 in Ascending order
./main 2 1 - Read/Write into rbt530_dev2 in Descending order

6. dmesg

7. rmmod rb530_drv.ko

8 rm main



The log files in the folder show a sample of the read/write of the rbtree.

There is also a Makefile to run on Galileo
